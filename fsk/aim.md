**Aim:**
### To Simulate virtually and Interpret Amplitude Shift Keying Modulation and De modulation waveforms
___
**Purpose:**
### To understand the modulation of a pulse signal into an analog high frequency signal. Interpreting ASK and its waveform will simplify the understanding of other analog and digital modulation techniques.
___
**Objective:**
+ To Simulate virtually and Interpret Amplitude Shift Keying Modulation and De modulation waveforms

+ To Demonstrate varying ASK waveforms with change in parameters like message frequency and carrier frequency
