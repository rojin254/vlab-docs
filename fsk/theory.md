## <br>INTRODUCTION <br>

 In communication, to transfer signal from one point to another efficiently many modulation techniques are used. Amplitude modulation is the pioneer technique used in communication to carrier message signal with help of high frequency waves.
 If the amplitude of the high frequency signal is simultaneously changed to that of the modulating signal, the process is termed as Amplitude Modulation.

## <b>CONCEPT</b><br>

 Out of the three parameters in any given waveform, ie., amplitude , frequency and phase, If the amplitude of message is varied with respect to the high frequency signal(Carrier) the resultant will a modulated signal.

<b>Under Modulation</b> <br>
If the depth of modulation is less than 1, then the resulting output is as shown in the figure.
