## <br>INTRODUCTION <br>

Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio applications. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is sampled regularly at uniform intervals, and each sample is quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps.

## <b>CONCEPT</b><br>

In PCM transmitter, the signal x(t) is first passed through the low-pass filter of cut-off frequency fm Hz. This low-pass filter blocks all the frequency components above fm Hz .This means that now the signal x(t) is bandlimited to fm Hz . The sample and hold circuit then samples this signal at the rate of fs. Sampling frequency fs is selected sufficiently above nyquist rate to avoid aliasing i.e., fs â‰¥ 2fm The output sample and hold circuit is denoted by x(nTs). This signal x(nTs) is discrete in time and continuous in amplitude.
