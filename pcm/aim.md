**Aim:**
### To Simulate virtually and Interpret Pulse Code Modulation and De modulation waveforms
___
**Purpose:**
### The basics of digitally modulting and analog signal starts with PCM. Interpreting PCM and its waveform will simplify the understanding of other analog and digital modulation techniques.
___
**Objective:**
+ To Simulate virtually and Interpret Pulse Code Modulation and De modulation waveforms

+ To Demonstrate varying PCM waveforms with change in parameters like sampling frequencty and no. of bits
