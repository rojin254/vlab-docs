**Aim:**
### To Simulate virtually and Interpret Frequency Modulation and De modulation waveforms
___
**Purpose:**
### The basic knowledge of communication engineering starts with Frequency Modulation. Interpreting FM and its waveform will simplify the understanding of other analog and digital modulation techniques.
___
**Objective:**
+ To Simulate virtually and Interpret Frequency Modulation and De modulation waveforms

+ To Demonstrate varying FM waveforms with change in parameters like frequency deviation and carrier frequency
